This is my journal for the game I am designing in College for my Game Design and Simulation class


My game is called City Escaper and it is a platform game where my character Roxanne runs around and shoots robots with her laser gun, does front flips across the

skyscrapers and tries to save her city, New York.

I have learned fron watching recent game development and siumulation:

How to open new scenes and game objects. I have to right click to create a new empty 2d object, to create a C# script to make it move left and right. Rename it player

movement. In the code use body.velocity to change it to move

how fast the player is moving and in which direction in order to sign the velocity we need to use vectorwhich is ca collection of numbers. to assign the speed in a number of directions.

That I need to download art to pick out the right characters for my game. To find the characters that go well with eah other and sound that would fit the background in my game. 

I have learned from Unity:

that I need a flash drive to work on school projects in the library. I learned how to download characters for my game off of Unity. I leanred 

that some packs have a demo scene you can look at before you decide to use that asset. Use the 2D react tool to view it in gae play mode and hange different elements 

aroumd to make it your own. Then go into sample scene to start making my own. Then you have to add a new sorting layer to make your background image go behind your 

first image. You need to put it on top. Call it background and foreground and change the sorting layer to background. Make a new animation folder to store the groups of

images in to make an animation. Its going to create a both an animation file and animation controller. Im trying to figure out tile maps in Unity. Right click in the 

scene and create a tile map. It creates an object called grid set the cell size to 2 by 2 so its larger. Select tile pallete create a new pallete select all the tiles and

bring them in. Right click snd create a new folder. To chaneg the size of the tiles right click all the tiles and change the pixels per unit. Set it 128 

                                                                   Jounral Entry 2 9/8/2022

I have learned fron watching recent game development and siumulation:

That I need to buy a new laptop because mine isnt good enough to run Unity. How to build tile maps for my game, how I would design a background for my 2D character to 

go on top of and move around off

Some issues I found were:

Building the tile maps is very difficult, I cant seem to figure out how to spread out my tile sheet to build the background. 

Some of the really good assets you have to pay for. 

I have learned from Unity: 

Trying to find the best best game packs for your game by scrolling through each of the tile packs to see which one best fits my game. I found the perfect asset I want 

for my game

                                                                         Jounral Entry 3 9/15/2022

I have learned fron watching recent game development and siumulation:

Change vector 2 to vector 3 and delete body velocity z then press play and you can move the character left and right. But the player is moving slow so go back and

create a float varible called speed and mutiple by input.get axis open square brackets and create seralizedfield before the speed varibe and set it to 10. implemnet 

the jump mechanic going to use an if statement change the velocity on the Y axis the player is now able to jump and move left and right.

I have learned from Unity: 

That I create my own custom game worlds easily and use coding to make them functional. I can use coding to make the player move left and right. To make the player jump

up and down. Opening up a gateway to a new hobby becasue this is really fun. 

Some issues I found were: 

A lack in the variety of free game designs I can use without having to pay for them, but at the same time I can coding to make my own custom game. 

                                                                     Jounral Entry 4 9/22/2022

I have learned fron watching recent game development and siumulation: how to input a custom sounds into my game to create a more unique gaming experince. 

I need to use the line of code instantiate then give it three different parameters inside of the parthesis the game object we want to spawn, second is the position at

we want to spawn it at and the third is what rotation we want to give it. you start by create a public varible called gameObject called object to spawn than instaniate

object to spawn vector 3.0 which will put it in the middle of the screen, quaternion.identity. our character gets spawned in our scene. 

I have learned from Unity: 

That varibles are very important and you can find them at the top of every script. Varibles are like boxes that store data they store some kind of value in them they 

are very useful to tweak properties of one of your objects. the speed of the damge it gives the partiles it gives off. If its public or private. Varbile type string

varible text Int varible whole numbers float number decimal numbers boolean varibles that are true or false. There are component types or features and we can store 

those in varibles ridgidbody varible. Create a public float varible called speed. Replace the hard coded number with the varible speed. Then we can finetune the speed

in the vector of unity. 

Some issues I found were: 

some of the scenes are hard to create. Coding brings a lot of detail and life to the game so learning coding will really help my game come to life. 

                                                                      Jounral Entry 5 9/26/2022

I have learned from Unity: 

I have leaarned how to add sprites and animation into my game. I discovered what tile maps are and have starting in corprating them into my game as well. 

Some issues I found were:

Coding is the most important part of game design and siumlation so im going to put my main focus on solving equations and figuring out formulas. 

I have learned fron watching recent game development and siumulation: how to input a custom sounds into my game to create a more unique gaming experince: 

I need to download it from package manager download 2D animation allow you to PSB files. I need to draw my own character to use for my game. 

                                                                      Journal Entry 6 10/06/2022

I have learned from Unity: 

I learned about the scene view where the characters are on a stage the order of cameraa and directional light do make a difference in 2D games. Prject folder as 

a warehouse. Weapons scene props, characerts go into it. Game objects, tranforms and components. Creating a game object collection of a transform and component. 

You can toggle the toolbar with wasd keyboard keys. How to create materials for my game. Adding dirt to a cube to turn it into a ground object that looks like a block 

of dirt with grass on top. Drag the dirt onto the cube. Then you duplicate the game object and the material and change the color to green. Then you add position to Y 

element and Scale X and Z. Then change the Y to 0.1 and that should create a grass block. Then you take the grass game object in the hierachy and move into the floor 

tile and it becomes a child of the floor tile game object. Then you create a prefab folder and drag your dirt block with grass on it into the new folder. Once you 

turn it into a prefaab you can easily place it in your scene now. Create a new empty object named level then drag all the tiles in the level game object. The 

few box colliders you have the faster your game will run. 

Some issues I found were: 

when creating two game objects to be one object I cant move them togther. Creating animations for characters is really difficult and requires blender. 

I have learned fron watching recent game development and siumulation:

How to create a player. Create a 3D object in the hierarchy and choose capsule. You can eventually use blender to create walk animation then you can upgrade it with a

sliding player then walking player. 

                                                                      Jounral Entry 7 10/13/2022 
                                                                   
I have learned from watching recent gaming development:

I need to use c# coding to make my character move around and I have to create the animations too to give 

my character a life like appearence that can that Idle, jump, front flip, back flip, die, walk, climb, shoot. In order to actaully make a game I first have to learn 

this to advance

I have learned from Unity:

I know what my game is going to be about, its going to be a platform game where my character Roxanne runs around with a laser gun and 

shoots robots and skeletons. She cant fall off of the builds or get attack by the robots and she has to survive until she runs out of hearts. 

Some issues I found were: 

its a lot harder to program than I thought, I have to teach myself how to code lines of game. My teacher sre as hell not ging teach me. 



                                                                      Jounral Entry 8 10/20/2022
                                                                   
I have learned from watching recent gaming development: 

There are fields properties and methods c# programming. The player what his health is at the moment how fas t hes running how high he jumps. 

Properties get the data inside these fields. I learned about float varibles.

I have learned from Unity: 

I have learned how to create tile maps and how to design my sets for my game. I cant decide if I should make my player move first or if I 

should create my background and then add my characters. 

Some issues I found were: 

Tile maps: I ran into some problems trying to create it. I dont know how to add my background and how to add the skyscrapers in the background. Ive been having trouble 

making my character move around and jump. 

                                                                     Journal Entry 9 10/27/2022

I have learned from watching recent gaming development:

I learned about using PathFinder for programming ememy AI. How my enemies travel around my game and how they

attack my character Roxanne. Using if/else statements to to make them move in different directions. If postive move to the right if negative move to the left.

I have learned from Unity:

I learnd how to make my enemies move faster with public float speed varibles similar to programm my main character. I am starting to see a

repeating pattern. Int, booleans, Rigidbody 2D, Get Compoenent, Vector 2. Creating different paths in coding. I learned how to make my enenmies follow my character and 

how to make they come to stop when they miss my character. 

Some issues I found were:

I ran into some issues debugging my code, my code breaking and stuff not working in Unity. I lose some of my data sometimes when I forget to 

save. 

                                                                     Journal Entry 10 11/3/2022

I have learned from watching recent gaming development: How to get my enemie to attack my player. First I need to make my background and my character to move around 

and jump around my level. That I need to make an public int called MaxHealth and set it to 10 and another public int called health. In the void start function to say

health = maxHealth. to make my player have full health from the start. How to create another varible TakeDamage whenever the player takes damage. If your health gets

to zero you die. 

I have learned from Unity: I learned from Unity that I need a seperate programming script for my enemies. With an OnCollisionEnter2D if the enemie runs into my player 

my player will take damage. How much damage my player will recieve whenever they get hit. 

Some issues I found were: 

When my player runs into my enemie, my character does not react to it. My enemie doesnt move around.

                                                                      Journal Entry 11 11/10/2022

So far, I have learned from watching recent gaming development: 

I have learned how to create a background for my game. How to design levels in Unity 2D with assets from 

the asset store. How to make my player move around and jump and attack. How to prograamm enemie AI to move around and attack my player. How to make my player take 

damage whenever they get attacked. 

I have learned from Unity: 

That I have to build a basic level before I can move on. So i can create my player and enemies. That I can add hearts in the top right coner of the screen to show my 

health levels just like in real video games. I need to animate Roxanne shooting her laser gun and the explosions afterward that happends when you shoot the enemie. 

Some issues I found were: 

In Unity there are steps you have to take. First you have to make your level and the platforms, then you add your character and program it 

move around. Then add enmeies and health points. When I tried to get my character to shoot her laser gun, she would face left and shoot to the right. Which was not 

what I wanted to do.
