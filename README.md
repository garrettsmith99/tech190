Journal Entry 1 

I have learned fron watching recent game development and siumulation.

I have to open new scene and game objects. Right click create C# script to make it move left and right. Rename it player movement. In the code use body.velocity to change

how fast the player is moving and in which direction in order to sign the velocity we need to use vectorwhich is ca collection of numbers. to assign the speed in a number of directions.

That I need to download art to pick out the right characters for my game. To find the characters that go well with eah other and sound that would fit the background in my game. 

I have learned from Unity:

that I need a flash drive to work on school projects in the library. I learned how to download characters for my game off of Unity. I leanred 

that some packs have a demo scene you can look at before you decide to use that asset. Use the 2D react tool to view it in gae play mode and hange different elements 

aroumd to make it your own. Then go into sample scene to start making my own. Then you have to add a new sorting layer to make your background image go behind your 

first image. You need to put it on top. Call it background and foreground and change the sorting layer to background. Make a new animation folder to store the groups of

images in to make an animation. Its going to create a both an animation file and animation controller. Im trying to figure out tile maps in Unity. Right click in the 

scene and create a tile map. It creates an object called grid set the cell size to 2 by 2 so its larger. Select tile pallete create a new pallete select all the tiles and

bring them in. Right click snd create a new folder. To chaneg the size of the tiles right click all the tiles and change the pixels per unit. Set it 128 

Some issues I found were:

Some of the really good assets you have to pay for. 

Trying to find the best best game packs for your game by scrolling through each of the tile packs to see which one best fits my game.


Jounral Entry 2 9/13/2022

I have learned fron watching recent game development and siumulation:

Change vector 2 to vector 3 and delete body velocity z then press play and you can move the character left and right. But the player is moving slow so go back and

create a float varible called speed and mutiple by input.get axis open square brackets and create seralizedfield before the speed varibe and set it to 10. implemnet 

the jump mechanic going to use an if statement change the velocity on the Y axis the player is now able to jump and move left and right.

I have learned from Unity: 

That I create my own custom game worlds easily and use coding to make them functional. I can use coding to make the player move left and right. To make the player jump

up and down. Opening up a gateway to a new hobby becasue this is really fun. 

Some issues I found were: 

A lack in the variety of free game designs I can use without having to pay for them, but at the same time I can coding to make my own custom game.

I have learned fron watching recent game development and siumulation: how to input a custom sounds into my game to create a more unique gaming experince. 

I need to use the line of code instantiate then give it three different parameters inside of the parthesis the game object we want to spawn, second is the position at

we want to spawn it at and the third is what rotation we want to give it. you start by create a public varible called gameObject called object to spawn than instaniate

object to spawn vector 3.0 which will put it in the middle of the screen, quaternion.identity. our character gets spawned in our scene. 

I have learned from Unity: 

That varibles are very important and you can find them at the top of every script. Varibles are like boxes that store data they store some kind of value in them they 

are very useful to tweak properties of one of your objects. the speed of the damge it gives the partiles it gives off. If its public or private. Varbile type string

varible text Int varible whole numbers float number decimal numbers boolean varibles that are true or false. There are component types or features and we can store 

those in varibles ridgidbody varible. Create a public float varible called speed. Replace the hard coded number with the varible speed. Then we can finetune the speed

in the vector of unity. 

Some issues I found were: 

some of the scenes are hard to create. Coding brings a lot of detail and life to the game so learning coding will really help my game come to life.
